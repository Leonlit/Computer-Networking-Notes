# Routers

## What are routers?
A router is a piece of network hardware which receives, analyse, and sends data on a computer network. Routers can have a combined function of network hubs, modems and network switches, and connects to the devices without any problem. Routers are to be said as a device that operates at layer three or the network layer in the OSI model. They are normally used in Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN)

## How Do Routers work?
The router which connects modem and also connected to other devices (wired or wireless) allows the communication to be established between the devices and the internet. Routers which includes those wireless ones, will normally have a few network ports to connect devices to the internet.

Routers will guide network data or packet which contains various type of files, communications or signals. In a data packet, it contains several layers or sections, which carries the information of the sender IP address, data type, destination IP address and the size of the data transported by the packet. Routers will read this information and will then prioritise and choose the best route for them in each packet transmission.

Beside routing the packet in the network, routers could also act as a simple network switch which allows multiple devices connected to the network to communicate with each other. For example, we can configure several computers in the same network to share a printer among themselves.

The functionality of a router is dependent on the routing table that’s built into the router. Routing tables store the available routes for all the possible destination. Every time a packet is transmitted to the router, the router will check with the routing table first to find the best route before transmitting the packet to the next network device in the network.

There’s two types of the routing table in Routers; Static and Dynamic routing table. A static routing table is where the destination route is manually set into the routing table. While for the static routing table, the routes are established by communicating with other routers using routing protocols.

## Where Does the Router is used?
There are many types of routers; some common ones are:

1. Wireless Routers

Provide WIFI connection & standard Ethernet routing

2. Broadband Routers

Connect to the internet through telephone and VoIP for high-speed internet access. Provided by Internet Service Provider (ISP)

3. Core Routers

Route data packet within the network, but not between networks. Construct the network backbone and used by ISP and communication interfaces

4. Edge Routers

Low-capacity routers placed at the periphery of networks. Distribute data to end-user, while normally don’t provide WIFI or ability to manage the local network fully.

5. Distribution routers

Receive data from Edge router via a wired connection to send it to end users via Ethernet or WIFI.


## Advantages of routers
 

- Increase productivity by providing a connection between multiple machines, network architecture and media.

- Act as an immediate defence device against attack outside from the network

- Reduce overall network traffic by using dynamic routing.

- Filter network packet with a set off filtering rules.

 

## Disadvantages of Routers

- Because of the need to analyse the data (packet) arrived, the device is slower than the repeater and bridges. Sometimes “Connection Wait” will occur, slowing down the overall connection.

- Cost more than other networking devices

- Complicated to setup (requires a lot of initial configuration and NAT setup)

- Routers consume bandwidth a lot as required to update routing table regularly.
